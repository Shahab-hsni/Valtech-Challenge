## Methods and Techniques

- Used sass for my styling and have seperated files for my variables and breakpoints (node-sass).

- Chose to go with functional component

- @testing-library/jest-dom is the dev dependency that I made use of for unit testing (I do not have a solid experience in unit testing but I tried my best, hope it suffices :) )

- Used Helmet for SEO
